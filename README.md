**WARNING:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!


Information about the order of scripts sourcing
-----------------------------------------------

For  Bash, they  work  as  follows. Read  down  the appropriate  column.
Executes A, then B,  then C, etc. The B1, B2, B3  means it executes only
the first of those files found.




## Inspiration ##

I   got   a    lot   of    stuff   from
[here](https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles), it  remains to see if  it is reallz
useful.
