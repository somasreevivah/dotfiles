using network manager - command line

Currently network-manager do not supply command line tools for configuring wpa-eap encrypted networks. so you need to edit network-manager configuration files by hand.

open the file /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/eduroam (as root), and enter the following text:

[ipv6]
method=ignore
ip6-privacy=0

[connection]
id=eduroam
uuid=167213e3-1a81-40c2-9371-a93e22a24648
type=802-11-wireless

[802-11-wireless-security]
key-mgmt=wpa-eap

[802-11-wireless]
ssid=eduroam
mode=infrastructure
security=802-11-wireless-security

[802-1x]
eap=peap;
identity=username%ra@huji.ac.il
ca-cert=/etc/ssl/certs/AddTrust_External_Root.pem
phase2-auth=mschapv2
password=YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE
private-key-password-flags=1
phase2-private-key-password-flags=1

[ipv4]
method=auto
may-fail=false

network manager should now connect automatically, if it dosn't, run:

nmcli con up id eduroam

to disconnect, type:

nmcli con down id eduroam

to check if you are connected, run:

nmcli con status
