# For instance, C-x would be Ctrl+X, or 4-space Mod4+Space

# Examples for vim-like menu bindings on a qwerty keyboard:
menu_parent h Left
menu_child  l Right
menu_down   j Down
menu_up     k Up
menu_select space Return

# Same for image navigation ...
next_img C-n
prev_img C-p

# and image movement
scroll_up    j C-Up
scroll_down  k C-Down
scroll_left  h C-Left
scroll_right l C-Right

# File deletion
remove     d
delete   C-d

# remove now conflicts with toggle_filenames, so change that
toggle_filenames b

# zooming
zoom_in  f
zoom_out F
zoom_default
zoom_fit W
# I only hit these accidentaly
save_image
save_filelist

# This leaves some conflicts with existing default bindings, but you should
# get the idea.  And I'm not gonna fix the conflicts, I don't use qwerty ;-)
